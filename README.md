# Ansible For DevOps

![Ansible](https://github.com/balusena/ansible-for-devops/blob/main/ansible.png)

Ansible for DevOps is a comprehensive guide to mastering automation with Ansible, tailored for DevOps professionals. It 
starts with an introduction to Ansible, its advantages over traditional scripting, and installation across platforms. 
You‚Äôll learn how to run powerful Adhoc commands for quick system management and write your first playbook to automate 
tasks like deploying web servers.

The guide dives deep into Ansible roles, exploring their structure and best practices, alongside hands-on demos using 
Ansible Galaxy for importing pre-built roles. Advanced topics like variables, Jinja2 templating, conditionals, loops, 
and error handling are covered, ensuring you can manage dynamic infrastructure.

Key security practices, like encrypting sensitive data with Ansible Vault, are highlighted. You‚Äôll explore network 
automation, policy as code, and a deep dive into Ansible Tower for enterprise-level management. Finally, advanced 
projects integrating Terraform with Ansible and a section on interview questions ensure a solid grasp of Ansible in 
DevOps environments.
